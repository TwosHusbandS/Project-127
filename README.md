<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Hi! This is a custom Client which was originally created to give all Speedrunners the capability of launching the Downgraded GTA Version 1.27. 

Over time it grew with Features and Launch - Capabilities

Note:

Project 1.27 now has the stability, user experience and core features we envisioned at the start of this project. While @dr490n and me (@thS / TwosHusbandS) both have ideas for potentially improvements and we may get around to working on them at some point, Project 1.27 is not under active development as of this very second (~~29th December, 2022~~ 27th March, 2024). Big bugfixes etc. will still happen if needed, but we are making no promises either way. We want to thank everyone who has been a part of this incredible journey.

### Help, How to get started, Support & Contact

* [Help, How to get started, Support & Contact][help-url]


### Main Features

* [List of Main Features here][features-url]


### Built With

Pretty much built with straight C# visualized with WPF
* Installer built using [InnoSetup](https://jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php)
* Some componments, mostly in regards to the Game Launch are closed source and written in C / C++
* The logging into your Social Club account is achieved by:
  * JavaScript
  * [Chrome Embedded Framework](https://github.com/cefsharp/CefSharp)


### Installation

* Grab the [latest Installer][installer-latest-url] from [the Installer folder][installer-folder-url]
* Execute said Installer
* Open Project 127

### User Instructions:

* **Get your GTA V Installation to an Up-To-Date State and launch the latest Version online to confirm that its working.**
* Grab the [latest Installer][installer-latest-url] from [the Installer folder][installer-folder-url]
* This Program does automatically detect the current State of the Installation (Downgraded or Upgraded) and launches the Game accordingly.
* Windows 10 Checks all Files for Viruses if they are run for the first time. If you open a file (the Installer or the Program) for the first time, please give it some time (up to 15 seconds) to do so, and just wait.
* This Program only supports 64 Bit at this Point and probably will never support 32 Bit. Seeing as GTA V only supports 64 Bit (AFAIK), and I doubt you can have a good time playing GTA V on less than 4 GB of RAM, this will probably stay this way.
* This Program also requires Admin-Rights for File Operations and Accessing the Registry for Settings. You do not need to start it as Admin, you will get the UserAccessControl Popup regardless of how this was started.
* Please actually Read the Popups the Program gives you
* In order to fully remove this Program and all of its files and settings click the Uninstall Button inside the Settings Window.
* [Changelogs can be found here][changelogs-url]
* If something is not working and you are contact me, I would appreciate the LogFile and the DebugFile, which are both in the InstallationFolder of this Program
* Read the Help Section if something is not working.


### Advanced User Instructions:

* Settings are in: Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Project_127 in the Registry
* The Files this Program needs (apart from the Client itself) are saved in a folder called "Project_127_Files" inside the Folder which you selected to use for ZIP File Extracting.
  * By default it recommends you to use your GTA Installation for that.
  * Again: Use your GTA Installation Folder for this.
* Theres a lot of stuff you can rightclick. I mean. A lot.

## Roadmap

Project 1.27 is not being actively developed at this stage.

It will continue to receive BugFixes and Hotfixes if needed. 

-----

## Contributing

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

* Clone the Github Repo.
* Pray Nuget does its magic.
* Press F5.
* In Order to check how stuff is connected id just recommend following User Actions and seeing what Methods are called.
* The whole Project ...historically grew a lot, and it shows.
* Some of the Code (especially XAML / GUI related) is not the best looking and far from best practice.
* If you can think of Improvements or new Features feel free to make a Pull Request or [contact me](#contact). 
* Can always use an extra pair of eyes to make sure I dont do anything stupid.
