### Changelog from 1.3.0.0 to 1.3.1.0:


* Completely re-factored the network code to be async and adapted the P127 GUI to work with async task to not block the UI Thread. Thanks to Gogsi for calling me out and making me finally implement it properly instead of slapping dirt fixes around sync network/UI tasks.
* Improved GTAV Stuck detection and user instructions
* Improved First-Launch GTAV Path detection
* Fixed UI Button Text on old import Button
* Fixed small issue with Overlay Preview in UI
* Fixed small issue for changing mode / github branch Popup
